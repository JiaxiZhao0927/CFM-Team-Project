Step 1: Data Cleaning
We should make sure that stocks meet the following requirements:
  1. in the US or Canada market
  2. average monthly volume > 100,000 shares from October 01, 2023 to September 30, 2024 (Drop any month that does not have at least 18 trading days.)

Step 2: Stock Rating and Ranking
  1. Rating based on market capitalization, returns, beta, etc.
  2. Sorting the stocks by using ranking

Step 3: Determine the Number of Stocks
Aiming closer to 24 stocks increases stability and minimizes individual stock risk, helping the portfolio better mirror market trends

Step 4: Select stocks and Determine weight
Requirements:
  1. Spend all $1,000,000 CAD
  2. (100/2n)% <= weight <= 15% 
  3. Transaction $0.001 per share, no more than $3.95

Step 5: Calculate Portfolio Return
